# Candle-Wood
A general-purpose graphing calculator for education.

## How to use, step by step

### Step 1
<p>You can either use the website, https://candlewood.netlify.app</p>
<p>Or you can use a JavaScript script to open a new window.</p>

```
javascript:window.open("https://candle-wood.codesalvageon.repl.co/", "", "width=501,height=601");
```

<p>You can put the above code in the URL and run it there, or you can open the console using inspect element and paste the following code:</p>

```
window.open("https://candle-wood.codesalvageon.repl.co/", "", "width=501,height=601");
```

* What happens if I see this error?

* All you need to do is refresh the page or run the script a second time.

### Step 2
<p>Either upload an image of the problem or enter the problem manually.</p>
